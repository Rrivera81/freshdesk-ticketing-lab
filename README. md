# 🖥️ Freshdesk Ticketing System Project (IT Helpdesk Simulation)

This project simulates a real-world IT Helpdesk environment using the **Freshdesk** ticketing system.
It demonstrates hands-on troubleshooting, user support, and technical documentation — all core skills required for IT Support, Cybersecurity, and SOC entry-level roles.
